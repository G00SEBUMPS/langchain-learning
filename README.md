# LangChain Learning Project

This repository contains my learning journey and experiments with LangChain, a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

## Project Overview

This project is focused on learning and implementing various features of LangChain, including:
- Chains
- Agents
- Memory
- Prompts
- Document loading and manipulation
- Vector stores and embeddings

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/G00SEBUMPS/langchain-learning.git
cd langchain-learning
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install uv
uv sync 
```
